        <p>" I heard about Better Balance Sports and Fitness while scrolling through Instagram. I saw my teammate Everett Charles working with him so I thought I should give it a shot. I worked with him throughout the whole summer. He helped me work on my footwork and on my balancing skills. Coach Brady was not just my trainor, he was like a brother to me. I would recommend Better Balance Sports and Fitness to everyone because I personally have been having a great season after working with him this summer."</p>

        <p>" I started working with Coach Brady after my Dad asked me if I wanted to get some extra training for football. I have been working with him for about a year and a half now. He really helped me improve my footwork and speed. I truly believe that he has helped me become a better reciever overall. I would recommend Better Balance Sports and Fitness to anyone who wants to be a better athelete but they have to be willing to work for it."</p>

        <p>"I learned about Better Balance Sports &amp; Fitness when I was playing football for North Side. I have been working with Better Balance Sports &amp; Fitness for about 3or 4 months. I am a quarterback so he helped me improve my footwork and my throwing accuracy. We usually do speed ladder drills and footwork drills. I would recommend BBSF to all athletes. Coach Brady is like a big brother to me, he believes in me even when I don't believe in myself."</p>

        <p>" I started working with Coach Brady after a friend from school came over and asked if I wanted to work out with them. I have been working with Coach Brady for two months and plan to continue working with him in the future. He has really helped me improve on my footwork, agility. He has also helped me learn to run my routes a lot better. Coach Brady is really a mentor, I really look up to him because of how he is achieving his dreams. He has given me the confidence that I have never had. I recommend Better Balance Sports and Fitness to everyone who is committed to getting in shape and becoming better in whatever sport they play."</p>
